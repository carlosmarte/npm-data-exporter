**Purpose**: This is a documentation file (INSTRUCTION.md) that provides usage examples and import instructions for the main JavaScript module (main.mjs). Its purpose is to help developers understand how to use the module's functionality.

**Technology**: JavaScript, ES6+ syntax, CommonJS modules (require/exports)

**Key Components**:

1. `DataExporter`: a class responsible for exporting data.
2. `JsonExportStrategy`, `CsvExportStrategy`: classes providing different export strategies (JSON and CSV).
3. `ExportStrategy`, `ExportStrategyFactory`: classes related to custom export strategies.

**Architecture**: The file demonstrates a simple modular design, where the main module exports specific classes or functions as needed. This is achieved through named imports (`import { ... } from "./main.mjs";`) and default imports (`import * as DataExporterModule from "./main.mjs";`).

**Dependencies**: The file depends on the `main.mjs` module, which likely contains the implementation of the exported classes and functions.

Overall, this file provides a clear overview of how to use the main JavaScript module, making it easier for developers to integrate its functionality into their projects.

**File:** `README.llm.md`

Here is the technical summary:

**Purpose**: This file provides an integration guide for the DataExporter library, which allows exporting data to various formats such as JSON and CSV with support for custom formats.

**Technology**: JavaScript/TypeScript module using the `@thinkeloquent/data-exporter` package.

**Key Components**:

* The main class is `DataExporter`, which has several key methods:
	+ `toJSON`, `toCSV`, `toMultiple`: Export data to specific formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).
	+ `export`: Generic method for exporting to any registered format.
* Global options and per-call options are used to customize the export behavior.

**Architecture**: The architecture appears to be a simple object-oriented design with a single class `DataExporter` that encapsulates the export functionality. No specific architectural patterns (e.g., MVC, MVP) or design principles (e.g., SOLID) are evident in the analyzed code.

**Dependencies**: Notable imports and libraries used:

* `@thinkeloquent/data-exporter`: The core DataExporter library.
* None other notable dependencies were found in the first 50 lines of code.

**File:** `main.mjs`

**Technical Summary of main.mjs (first 50 lines)**

1. **Purpose**: This file implements an abstract export strategy using the Strategy Pattern, providing a flexible way to generate and save data in various formats.
2. **Technology**: The programming language is JavaScript (using ECMAScript modules), with imports from:
	* `fs` (promises) from "fs" for file system operations
	* `path` for working with file paths
3. **Key Components**:
	* `ExportStrategy`: an abstract class defining the export strategy interface and implementing the Strategy Pattern.
	* Concrete export strategies will inherit from this class and implement the abstract methods.
4. **Architecture**: The design pattern used is the Strategy Pattern, which allows for the decoupling of algorithm implementations from their clients. Additionally, the Template Method Pattern is employed in the `export` method to provide a consistent interface for concrete strategy implementations.
5. **Dependencies**:
	* `fs` promises (from "fs") for file system operations
	* `path` for working with file paths
